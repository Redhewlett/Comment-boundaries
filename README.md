# ✨Comment boundaries✨

A Script that notifies your users if their comment could be to others.🤩 giving them a chance to change their comment or correct what they wanted to say.

# ❗ "Disclaimer" ❗

This is just a showcase of a script that takes a comment and uses an array of flagged words/words combo to prevent users from bullying others with their
comments. (it's a facebook list provided by Free Web Headers – https://www.freewebheaders.com)

With that in mind i just used the app.tsx to work. There for, excuse the lack of components. I also used this quick project to work with both Typscript and
Tailwind.

# functionalities
